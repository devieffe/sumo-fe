## Person subject summary react/next.js component  

An AI-powered web application built with **Next.js 15**, **OpenAI**, and **SerpAPI** that generates concise 200-word biographies of real people based on live search results — with built-in IP-based rate limiting.

## Features

- **Live web search**: Uses SerpAPI to gather top links for the query.
- **Smart summarization**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT model to analyze and summarize the most relevant subject.
- **Name disambiguation**: If the name refers to multiple individuals, the app selects one based on most common parameters.
- **Rate limiting**: Restricts usage to a few requests per session.
- **Next.js 15 App router** with API routes and `app/` directory.
- Fully type-safe and ESLint-compliant (`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` safe).
